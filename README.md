# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC) ðŸš€

## Overview

### The Challenge

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

* SCSS
* Mobile first workflow
* JS, Jquery

### What I learned

I saw this as a continueation of [my first project](https://github.com/devjoppe/qr-code-component) on Frontend mentors. Here I wanted to focus to code the design exactly as the specification and working on my SCSS skills.  A new challenge was the use of Javascript to make the functionality work. I used jquery for some of the functions (right or wrong) - still learning.

Overall, a fun challenge. Let's go to the next one!
